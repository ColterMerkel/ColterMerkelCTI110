My first repository test.

My GitHub account is brand new. I will be using it in my CTI 110 class.
This repository I created is my first. It is an overall test see figure out of it all works.
I first had to create a repository on the website GitHub from there I published it. I then downloaded GitHub to my desktop. Once downloaded I signed in. I went to file in the top left and clicked clone repository. I then selected the repository I wanted to clone.
